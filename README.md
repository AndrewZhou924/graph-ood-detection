### Relation to the anomaly detection problem

Unlike traditional anomaly detection, which assumes a small percentage of anomalies, 
in the graph domain, the OOD part may contain nodes that are comparable in size to the ID part.

Anomaly graphs are usually malicious samples from a real system and available during training; while OOD graphs are samples from the distribution that the model has not seen during training.
